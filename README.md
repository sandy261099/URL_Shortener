# URL_Shortener

This is a URL shortener application which I have created using Lambda Functions and have used the DynamoDB as the database.

The application initially looks like this:

After giving the link, the system generates a 5 digit alpha numeric string.

This String can be used after the domain name in order to access the destination website. 

Here is the url for the website.
